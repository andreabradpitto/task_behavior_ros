# Behavior Tree ROS Integration - Python3 #

This is my fork of the [task_behavior_ros package](https://github.com/ToyotaResearchInstitute/task_behavior_ros). This version works with Python3 (instead of Python2) and provides an easier installation method.

In order to install it execute the following commands. Assuming *~/catkin_ws* is the active ROS workspace on your machine:

```sh
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/andreabradpitto/task_behavior_ros.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

The code has been tested on ROS Noetic.
